<h2 id="desc" class="list">Level of Trust Assessment Ontology for Continuum Computing: Description <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h2>

<p>The Level of Trust Assessment Function (LoTAF) designed by the flagship Hexa-X-II project represents a neutral and
    bi-directional mechanism in charge of evaluating trust aspects in a 6G end-to-end service like the Cloud Continuum. LoTAF is continuously collecting and analysing objective and subjective trust indicators,
    forming a knowledge graph between the trustor and the trustee, by making use of graph queries to identify relevant patterns or series of changes in the graph that may impact the LoT,
    keeping track of real-time events and shifts in telemetry values. The Level of Trust (LoT) is considered as a new intent that enables the management and orchestration of intent-based management (IBN) solutions.
    In this regard, this ontology is released by following the well-known Linked Open Term methodology which is also contemplated in ETSI SAREF standards. The ontology uses a soft-reuse strategy including the URIs of
    other existing ontologies in order to reduce redundancy and ease interoperability. For example, such an ontology inherits classes and properties from the TR292 TM Forum Intent Ontology. Nevertheless, the core of
    the ontology is built from scratch as terms like Cloud Continuum, Service Assurance, Trust Level Agreement, or Level of Trust have not been considered in prior solutions.</p>
<p>The entities of this ontology are mainly split into two main blocks: (i) level of trust assessment and (ii) intent-based management for cloud scenarios. The former aims at representing the
    principal concepts, data properties, and object properties related to our trust evaluation systems. In this vein, the ontology tries to represent information from
    the type of trust indicators (quantitative and qualitative), the business agreement between trustor and trustee(s), key actions to be applied after misbehaviours or desired behaviors and symptoms concerning assets'
    behaviors. The latter block deals with the intent-based terms of Cloud continuum scenarios where decomposing the intent into the capabilities of multiple digital service providers is envisioned.
    Managing 6G E2E services requires the involvement of several service providers (e.g., network service providers, cloud service providers) to compose an E2E service and, this block aims to embody the minimum information
    to contemplate trust as an intent for several types of network services and assets.</p>
<p>Note that this ontology is a live process of the Hexa-X-II project, which is active until 30 June 2025 and may undergo changes based on the iterations of the project. In addition, some parts of the IBN or Cloud Continuum
    representation may not be covered in depth as they fall outside the main objective of LoTAF, which is to assess and report the trust levels of a security service in different Cloud Continuum scenarios based on the input
    requirements of a Digital Service Consumer.</p>

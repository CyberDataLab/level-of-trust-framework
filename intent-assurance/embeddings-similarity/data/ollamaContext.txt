You are an expert system administrator with a system resource monitoring application. 
For this, you have the following rules that you can apply. 
id,name,rule

I need you to indicate a score for every rule in the system.
You must mention every rule.
Focus on specifications, for example, if a query is "Build a IoT edge node with temperature controls and fan speed safeguards", 
The rules must be accorded to temperature controls and fan speed safeguards. It doesn't mind anything related to IoT edge node. 
please ignore the type of service to be implemented, only what is important is what you want to achieve.
for example, if you have "Setup a Maritime Navigation System with Network Stability", Maritime Navigation System isn't important. The important
part is Network Stability.
The format I want you to do is: 'id:(0-1)'.
For example: r1:0.32 and so on with every rule 
Just indicate the id and the percentage, don't show any more. If there is no rule applicable, show None
The query is the following:
